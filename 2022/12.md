There's a mountain and it's mighty high
U cannot see the top unless U fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't no where 2 go if U hang around
Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if U ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold

There's an ocean of despair
There are people livin' there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so what U tryin' 2 say? 
Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if U ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold


There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now that's a theory and if U don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way 4 those who want 2 go
Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told
What's the use of bein' young if U ain't gonna get old?
Even at the center of fire there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold

How beautiful do the words have 2 be / Before they conquer every heart?
How will U know if I'm even in the right key / If U make me stop before I start?

If I came back as a dolphin / Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend? / Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins / But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

Why does my brother have 2 go hungry / When U told him there was food 4 all?
This is the man that stands next 2 the man / That stands 2 catch U when U fall

If I'm under water, will U find me? / Will U shine a light and try 2 guide me?
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door / But U wouldn't let me in

How beautiful do the words have 2 be / Before they conquer every heart?
